# LemonWeather
This Project was made for learning to pull API data using python

## About The Project
This Project was following the guide below:  
[Weather App](https://realpython.com/build-a-python-weather-app-cli/)

I have used python to create a website for the api data. 

### Prerequisites

- Python
- venv
  - pip
  - Streamlit

### Install
-- The instructions below are for linux --

Create a directory to store the venv:  
```mkdir directory_name```  
```cd directory_name ```

To create a Venv :  
```python -m venv venv_environment```

Activate the venv:  
``` cd venv_environment ```   
``` cd bin ```   
``` source activate ``` 

Install the packages through pip:  
```pip install streamlit```
